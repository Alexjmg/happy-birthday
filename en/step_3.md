## What is HTML?

HTML stands for __HyperText Markup Language__, and is the language used to make webpages. Let's have a look at an example!




+ You'll be using a website called Trinket to write HTML. Open this Trinket: <a href="http://jumpto.cc/web-intro" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/web-intro</a>. 

	The project should look like this:

+ The code that you can see on the left of the Trinket is HTML. On the right of the Trinket you can see the webpage that the HTML code has made.

	HTML uses __tags__ to build webpages. Can you see this HTML at line 8 of your code?

	```
	<p>Hi. My name is Andy.</p>
	```

	`<p>` is an example of a tag, and is short for __paragraph__. You can start a paragraph with `<p>` and end a paragraph with `</p>`.

+ Can you spot any other tags? One other tag you might have spotted is `<b>`, which stands for __bold__:

	```
	<b>running</b>
	```

	Here are some more:

	+ `<html>` and `</html>` mark the start and end of the HTML document;
	+ `<head>` and `</head>` is where stuff like CSS goes (we'll get to that later!);
	+ `<body>` and `</body>` is where your website content goes.

+ Make a change to one of the paragraphs of text in the HTML (on the left). Click 'Run' and you should see your webpage change (on the right)!

+ If you have made a mistake and want to undo your changes, you can click the menu button and then click 'Reset'. Try it!

__You don't need a Trinket account to save your projects!__ 

If you don't have a Trinket account, click the down arrow and then click 'Link'. This will give you a link that you can save and come back to later. You'll need to do this every time you make changes, as the link will change!

If you have a Trinket account, the easiest way to save your webpage is to click the 'Remix' button on the top of the Trinket. This will save a copy of the Trinket on your profile.
