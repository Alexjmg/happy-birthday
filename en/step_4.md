## What is CSS?

CSS stands for __Cascading Style Sheets__, and is the language used to style webpages and make them look nice. You can link your webpage to a CSS file in the `<head>` of an HTML document like this:

+ CSS lists all of the __properties__ for a particular tag. Click the 'style.css' tab to see the CSS for your webpage.

+ Find this code:

	```
	p {
		color: black;
	}
	```

	This CSS code has one property for paragraphs, which is that the text colour should be black.

+ Change the word 'black' in the CSS to 'blue'. You should see the text colour of all paragraphs change to blue.
