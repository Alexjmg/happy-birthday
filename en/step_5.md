## What is CSS?

CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**, and is the language used to style webpages and make them look nice.

This code links your webpage to a CSS file.

+ Can you find this code in the `<head>` of the HTML document?

+ Find this code:

```html
p {
	color: black;
}
```

This CSS code has a property for paragraphs (p), which says that the text colour should be black. Notice the American spelling - 'color'.

+ Change the word 'black' in the CSS to 'blue'. You should see the text colour of all paragraphs change to blue.
