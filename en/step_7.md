## Making a birthday card

Let's use what you've learnt about HTML and CSS to make your own custom birthday card.



+ Open this Trinket: <a href="http://jumpto.cc/web-card" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/web-card</a>, or use the embedded version below if you're reading this online.

<div class="trinket">
  <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/html/90506676c9" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

Don't worry if you don't understand all of the code. This birthday card looks pretty boring, so you're going to make some changes to this HTML and CSS.

+ Click the button on the front of the card, and you should see it open to reveal the inside.

+ Go to line 14 of your code. Just like in the earlier example, you can edit any of the text in the HTML to customise the card.

+ Can you find the HTML for the robot image? (Hint: it's on line 17!) Change the word `robot` to `sun`, and you'll see the image change!

	You can use any of the words `boy`, `diamond`, `dinosaur`, `flowers`, `girl`, `rainbow`, `robot`, `spaceship`, `sun`, `tea`, or `trophy`.

+ You can also edit the CSS of the birthday card. Click on the tab for “style.css”. It begins with all of the CSS for the `outside` of the card. Change the `background-color` to `lightgreen`.

+ You can also change the size of an image. Go to the `#outside-pic` CSS, and change the `width` and `height` of the outside image to `200px` (`px` stands for pixels).

+ The font can be changed too. Go to the `#outside-title` CSS and change the `font-family` to `Comic Sans MS` and the `font-size` to `16pt`.

	You can use other fonts like <span style="font-family: Arial;">arial</span>, <span style="font-family: impact;">Impact</span> and <span style="font-family: tahoma;">Tahoma</span>.
