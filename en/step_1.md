## Introduction:
In this project, children will be introduced to HTML tags & CSS properties. They will also edit tags and properties to make their own customised greeting card.

## Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinkets:

+ ['Intro to HTML and CSS' starting point -- jumpto.cc/web-intro](http://jumpto.cc/web-intro)
+ ['Birthday Card' starting point  -- jumpto.cc/web-card](http://jumpto.cc/web-card)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-blank)](http://jumpto.cc/html-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-template)](http://jumpto.cc/html-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ ['Birthday Card' Finished -- trinket.io/html/e996dc0380](https://trinket.io/html/e996dc0380)

## Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/webdev-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ intro/index.html
+ template/template.html
+ template/style.css
+ birthday-card/index.html
+ birthday-card/style.css
+ birthday-card/script.js
+ birthday-card/10 x .png images

You can also find a completed version of this project's challenges in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ birthday-card-finished/index.html
+ birthday-card-finished/style.css
+ birthday-card-finished/script.js
+ birthday-card-finished/rainbow.png
+ birthday-card-finished/dinosaur.png

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

## Learning Objectives
+ This project introduces HTML tags and CSS properties, and allows children to edit content and styling.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Design basic 2D and 3D assets](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/design/creator).

## Challenges
+ "Add another paragraph" - adding an HTML tag to a document;
+ "Add more style" - editing CSS styles;
+ "Create a personalised card" - editing HTML and CSS to make a greetings card.

## Frequently Asked Questions

+ This project makes use of the javascript `prefixfree.js` library, to allow animation compatibility between browsers. If this library isn't used, then children using older browsers will instead need to declare an animation for their browser, for example:

```
animation: sky 10s infinite; 		  	//for all newer browsers
-webkit-animation: sky 10s infinite;  	// For Webkit browsers(Chrome, Safari...)
-moz-animation: sky 10s infinite;     	// For Mozilla browsers
-o-animation: sky 10s infinite;       	// For Opera browsers
-ms-animation: sky 10s infinite;		// For Microsoft browsers 
```
